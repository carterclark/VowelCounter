# VowelCounter
Implements a class (VowelCounter.java) that (a) reads a string from the user and then (b) prints how many of each vowel appears in the string. This test for vowels is case-insensitive. i.e., the vowels in either lower-case a, e, i, o, u, or upper-case A, E, I, O, U have a separate counter for each vowel. The program will continue to prompt the user for new strings to test, until the user enters the letter "q" to quit the program.
